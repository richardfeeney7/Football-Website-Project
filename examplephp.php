At this Section we will show you some of the host cities and stadiums. These cities and venues are steeped in tradition and are as you would
                      expect from the French, oozing with class. The Euros will be a very busy time for hotels and other accommodation in the areas. The accommodation 
                      will most likely fill up fast so it is important that you make plans and any booking in advance so you will not miss out on the accommodation and possibly seeing the games that you are interested in. There are plenty of good website that help with booking packages. Book soon as the hotels will so be filled to capacity.
